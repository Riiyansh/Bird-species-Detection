# Bird Species Prediction App

## Overview
The Bird Species Prediction App is a machine learning project designed to classify bird species based on images. This project leverages computer vision techniques and a trained model to identify various bird species with high accuracy. The application is built using Python, and it utilizes popular libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV.

## Features
- **Image Upload:** Users can upload images of birds to the app.
- **Species Prediction:** The app predicts the species of the bird in the uploaded image.
- **Model:** A deep learning model trained on a dataset of bird species images.
- **User Interface:** A simple and intuitive user interface for easy interaction.

## Installation
To get started with the Bird Species Prediction App, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://https://github.com/Riiyansh/Bird-species-Detection/edit/main/README.md


## Dataset
The model was trained on a publicly available bird species dataset, which contains thousands of images across various species. The dataset was preprocessed and augmented to improve the model's performance.

## Model
The model architecture is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for image classification tasks. It was trained using TensorFlow and Keras, achieving a high accuracy on the validation set.

## Usage
Upload an Image: The user can upload an image of a bird through the app interface.
Prediction: Once the image is uploaded, the model will process it and predict the species of the bird.
Result: The predicted species name will be displayed along with the confidence level of the prediction.
Results
The model has been tested on a variety of bird species images and has shown promising results with high accuracy. The app can identify common bird species and can be further improved by training on a larger dataset.

## Future Work
Improvement in Accuracy: Fine-tuning the model and training on a larger dataset to improve prediction accuracy.
Adding More Species: Expanding the dataset to include more bird species for broader coverage.
Mobile App Integration: Developing a mobile version of the app for easy access on the go.
